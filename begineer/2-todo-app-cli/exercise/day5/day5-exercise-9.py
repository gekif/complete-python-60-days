'''
We have defined a list in the coding area. Add some code that:
(1) iterates over the items of mylist,
(2) prints out the current length of the list in each iteration

Here is how the output would look like:
4
4
4
4

mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

for item in mylist:
    print(len(mylist))
